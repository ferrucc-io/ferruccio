# The source for the ferrucc.io site

In this repository you can find the source of my personal blog.

The site is a static Hugo blog hosted on GitHub Pages. It's currently running on Hugo 0.84.4.

## CI/CD Setup

The site is now automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions. When you push changes to the `main` branch, the site will be automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages.

The build process:
1. Uses Hugo 0.84.4 to build the site
2. Publishes the built site to the `gh-pages` branch
3. GitHub Pages serves the site from the `gh-pages` branch

## Local Development

To run this site locally, clone the repository and install the correct theme:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

You can now run the development server with Hugo:

```bash
# For development (includes drafts)
hugo server -D --config config.dev.toml

# For production-like local build
hugo server --config config.dev.toml
```

The development server will be available at `http://localhost:1313/`.

## Building Locally

If you need to build the site locally for testing:

```bash
# Build for development
hugo --config config.dev.toml

# Build for production (same as CI)
hugo --config config.toml
```

## Adding Content

To add a blog post run the following command:

```bash
hugo new posts/[your post title].md
```

To add a page run the following command:

```bash
hugo new [your page title].md
```

## Updating the Theme

After you update the theme run:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

So that the git submodule gets updated.

## Important Notes

- The `docs/` folder is now ignored by git and will be generated by CI/CD
- Local development uses `config.dev.toml` which publishes to the `public/` folder
- Production builds use `config.toml` which publishes to the `docs/` folder
- The site is automatically deployed when you push to the `main` branch
