# This is Ferruccio's personal website
All the code powering https://ferrucc.io is right here in this repository. 

It's just some HTML, a sprinkle of CSS and a couple of lines of Javascript. 

Feel free to look around, but there's not much to see. The code for this website is not optimised in any way. When I feel like sometimes I change something in the pages.
