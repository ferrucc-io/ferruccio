I'm mostly a web developer, but the Swift programming language and writing native code has always been something I wanted to explore more in depth.

Swift functions are strongly typed and let you know in advance what kind of data they handle:

```swift
func sendMessage (text: String, user: User) -> (Result) {
    /// Your code
    return res
}
```

What I found a bit counter intuitive was variable declaration which works in the following way:

```swift
// for variables
var text : String = "a string of text"
// for constants
let number : Int = 21
```
