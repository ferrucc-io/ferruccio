I'm Ferruccio Balestreri

I spend most of my time working on [June](https://june.so) - *we're hiring so reach out if you'd like to work with me*

I also help out with building [Balloon](https://balloonguthealth.com/) - an app to help women improve their gut health.

Over the years I've made [so many projects](/projects) that I've lost count.

I like to run [experiments](/experiments), like publicly streaming my [browsing history](/history).
