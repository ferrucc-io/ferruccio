Hello my name is Ferruccio Balestreri.

I come from Milan, Italy ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ but this doesn't mean I'm a great cook.

I like to code and my favorite programming language is Clojure. If you're interested in learning it [start from here](https://www.braveclojure.com/).

Over the years I've made so many projects that I've lost the count. In this website you can find some articles on what I've learned.

I'm actively collecting a list of useful resources that I take inspiration from and you can find it [here](/references).

I'm only 21 so it would be pretentious to say I've got all the answers on life, but I hope you'll find my experiences and findings useful. I don't trust anyone that gives orders on how to think or do things, I'm also not interested in most opinions. 

In fact I don't read newspapers, but I like to expose myself to large amounts of data to form opinions.

I'm more interested about macro trends then what happens in the day to day as I find that the world moves to certain equilibriums.

After reading this you might think I love high level discussions, but truth is I really enjoy everything that is practical.

Now I'll get back to work on something more meaningful than the about section of my blog. And I'd suggest you did that too.

## My Biggest Influences and fav ðŸ’• blogs:
[Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html): These essays are what made me think that I should learn a Lisp, eventually this brought me to Clojure.
