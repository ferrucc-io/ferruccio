Hello my name is Ferruccio Balestreri.

I come from Milan, Italy and I write code, design and write blog posts.

My favorite programming language is Clojure. If you're interested in learning it [start from here](https://www.braveclojure.com/).

Over the years I've made [so many projects](/projects) that I've lost count. In this website you can find some articles on what I've learned.

I'm actively collecting a list of useful resources that I take inspiration from and you can find it [here](/references). And this is my [browsing history](/history).

I'm only 21 so it would be pretentious to say I've got all the answers on life, but I hope you'll find my experiences and findings useful. I don't trust anyone that gives orders on how to think or do things, I'm also not interested in most opinions. 

In fact I don't read newspapers, but I like to expose myself to large amounts of data to form opinions.

I'm more interested about macro trends then what happens in the day to day as I find that the world moves to certain equilibriums.

After reading this you might think I love high level, dreamy discussions, but truth is I really enjoy getting my hands dirty and creating things.

Now I'll get back to work on something more meaningful than the about section of my blog. And I'd suggest you did that too.

A good place to start could be picking up something from [reading list](/reading).
