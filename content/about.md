I'm Ferruccio Balestreri

Most of my time is spent working on [June](https://june.so) - *we're hiring so reach out if you'd like to work with me*

Over the years I've made [so many projects](/projects) that I've lost count. In this website you can find some articles on what I've learned.

I also like to run [experiments](/experiments), like publicly streaming my [browsing history](/history).

I don't trust anyone that gives orders on how to think or do things, I'm also not interested in most opinions. 

In fact I don't read newspapers, but I like to expose myself to large amounts of data to form opinions.

After reading this you might think I love high level, dreamy discussions, but truth is I really enjoy getting my hands dirty and creating things.
