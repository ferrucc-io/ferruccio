Since starting to work on June, I haven't read a lot of books. I only read a few Substack posts for fun and go out for long walks.

My favorite blog right now is [Samo Burja's Bismarck Brief](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/). Every week I get a new post on something I would've never thought of being interesting.

I also like reading the [Palladium Magazine](https://palladiummagazine.org/).

Occasionally, I also like reading reactionary blogs like Curtis Yarvin's [Gray Mirror](https://graymirror.substack.com/) - but I've found them a bit too repetitive with time. I enjoy reading about edgy ideas of every kind, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know!

I'll get back to reading books when I'm less busy with work.
