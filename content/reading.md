Since starting to work on June, I haven't read a lot of books. I only reads a few Substack posts for fun and go out for long walks.

My favorite blog right now is [Samo Burja's Bismarck Brief](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/). Every week I get a new post on something I would've never thought of being interesting.

Other than that I like reading reactionary blogs from people like Curtis Yarvin.

I'll get back to reading books when I'm less busy with work.
