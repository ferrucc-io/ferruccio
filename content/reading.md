Since starting to work on my company I haven't read a lot of books. I only reads a few Substack posts for fun and go out for long walks.

My favorite blog right now is [Samo Burja's Bismarck Brief](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/). Every week I get a new post on something I would've never thought of being interesting.

Other than that I like reading reactionary blogs from people like Curtis Yarvin.

### When Breath Becomes Air

At the end of 2018 [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/) told me to read this book.

It's about how doctors think and made me think about meaning and how to die with dignity. I strongly recommend.

### Made in America

What really stuck with me was the first autobiography I ever read: "Made in America" by Sam Walton.

I think that the powerful ideas of "every penny we save is a penny our customers save" is the only way to keep a huge corporation lean and not wasteful.

In the Jeff Bezos biography they say that this book strongly influenced the culture of Amazon.

### Hackers and Painters

This collection of essays by Paul Graham was a mind blowing read. 

After reading this I started learning Common Lisp and eventually Clojure (as I couldn't figure out how to build anything useful with CL).

### [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/) 

Reading Ryan's posts I fully embraced the idea that in communication the most important things is honesty. 

Honesty shines through and brings trust.

It's a long term play, but it's worth it.
