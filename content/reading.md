Since starting to work on June, I haven't read a lot of books. I only read a few Substack posts for fun and go out for long walks.

My favorite blog right now is [Samo Burja's Bismarck Brief](https://brief.bismarckanalysis.com/). Every week I get a new post on something I would've never thought of being interesting.

I also like reading [Palladium Magazine](https://palladiummagazine.org/).

Recently, after listening to Chris Arnade's podcast interview with Tyler Cowen I've been enjoying reading his newsletter *[Chris Arnade Walks the World](https://walkingtheworld.substack.com/)*.
