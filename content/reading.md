I spend a lot of time reading things on the internet and on books.

**What had a strong influence on me?**

**What is something that shaped who I am?**

Everything below here is my answer to those questions:

### When Breath Becomes Air

At the end of 2018 [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/) suggested that I read this book.

I'm so glad I followed his advice as it was moving to read this.

Being a fairly happy person, I almost always the topic of death and health, in my reading list and even in my daily thoughts.

I think this spans from the fact that my ideas on religion and faith are very confused.

If you want to read about how doctors think, think about meaning and how to die with dignity I strongly recommend this book.

### Made in America

I really started reading around 4 years ago. I thought I had found a secret weapon that would make me change for the better.

What really stuck with me was the first autobiography I ever read: "Made in America" by Sam Walton.

I think that the powerful ideas of "every penny we save is a penny our customers save" is the only way to keep a huge corporation lean and not wasteful. I read in the Jeff Bezos biography that this book strongly influenced the culture of Amazon and how it operates.

### Hackers and Painters

This collection of essays by Paul Graham was a mind blowing read. 

After reading this I started learning Common Lisp and eventually Clojure (as I couldn't figure out how to build anything useful with Common Lisp).

### [Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/) 

Reading Ryan's posts I fully embraced the idea that in communication the most important things is honesty. 

Honesty shines through and brings trust.

It's a long term play, but it's worth it.

### [James Altucher](https://jamesaltucher.com/)

This guy is a scammer selling info products on anything that is hot (crypto, stocks, self help.. maybe even weight loss).

But after reading some of his posts I started writing in a different way. He's able to show his vulnerabilities in his words. The things I read about him were emotionally touching and extremely refreshing.

He builds trust showing his vulnerabilities and that's something I want to do too.

### Nathan Barry

I haven't read much by him, but I know he embraces the idea of sharing everything he learns.

I think I heard a podcast with him, and his words really resonated with me

He adds a new dimension to the two values I listed before, adding "openness" to honesty and vulnerability.
