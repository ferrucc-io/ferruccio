I like building things without thinking too much. This works extremely well when building something small on your own.

When working with other people this doesn't scale.
Having a rational method and strategy in approaching problems allows your team to make decisions independently, so you can move faster.

If you want to build something amazing having a strong method makes all the difference. 

While building [June](https://june.so) me and Enzo have defined our process and are sharing it with you. 

**With the hope that It will help you build something amazing**

To keep this process pragmatic, we're going to use June, our product, as an example.

## What to build

We want to build a product analytics software.

Almost a year ago me and Enzo were talking about starting a business together.
After discussions about who we like talking to we realised we love those who build new things into the world.
We believe that analytics software is what enables people to build better products.

So for the next 10 years we decided to narrow our focus and learning efforts to become the best in the world at product analytics.

### Problems with the current solutions

To learn what we should build first we started from our personal experience. We used our experience to draft a User Research template (you can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P_8US1nRmsXcEbv-OL8scNWQi_bb_Kx2puOBuUHRWuw/)).

We ran almost 100 user interviews with Product people (from leaders to product managers) at the best companies in the world.

We then collected all our learnings in a pain point map

All these pain points together with our intuition helped us pick the main problems we want to tackle

- Data is not reliable and opaque
- “I am not independent in my analysis”
- It's hard to understand behaviours


### Requirements

**So what are caracteristics of our solution?**

* Easy to adopt
* Transparency on data
* Friendly and approachable even with no training
* Non technical people have to be able to gain meaningful insights


## Rules of the universe

These requirements then feed into some **Rules of the Universe**, the guiding principles to build our product.

> A Principle is a strong opinion that is used to make decisions in a fast and consistent way

1. **No black boxes**

Data can be visualized and transformed in an invidual and bulk way from the UI

2. **The steps to go from measurement to some action are streamlined**

The product is built around how the team works, not the other way around.

3. **Optimise for the most common question not the most complex one**

Optimise for speed and ease of use of the happy path use case

4. **Guarantee trust in data**

Be conservative and aim for a quality over quantity in data collection and analysis

5. **Context specific over generic use cases**

Optimise for the context over the method of analysis. 
eg. Build tools to measure signup activation, not tools to visualize a sequence of events that is triggered in your signup flow.


## Positioning

Your product has to be a good fit for someone, it has to serve a market. June is built for non technical product managers.

June is the simplest product analytics solution. We answer the most common questions product teams ask themselves (or should be asking).

* Do you have product market fit?
* How is the latest feature launch going?
* Is the increased discoverability of this feature increasing adoption?
* Who are your most successful users?

## Prototyping

The next step after positioning the product is turning it into either some mockups, a principle project or a frontend only prototype.

The idea here is to see concretely the look and feel of the app.

## Scoping

Once you have a clear idea of where you're going - you can take a step back - and pick the smallest set of features that makes a lovable product.

You have to be ruthless in this effort. If after finishing this exercise everyone in your team isn't in tears and embarassed of the result then you probably didn't cut enough.

The idea here is to set a deliberately ambitious deadline of something like 2 weeks to get to something that works end to end.

## Building

This part is the most straightforward, just put your heads down, set small goals and reach them consistently.

We started with a cupcake, but are working towards a wedding cake.

All this is hard work though... maybe you could help with some extra hands.
