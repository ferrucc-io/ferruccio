Here's a list of experiments I did:

1. Publicly Sharing my browsing history - more about this [here](/history)
2. Fiverr profile - The goal of this experiment was to see how efficient the internet is at talent discovery and monetization of hard skills. I didn't manage to get any clients except for a friend, so it was a failed experiment.

3. Calls with strangers [Original Tweet](https://twitter.com/0xferruccio/status/1133286166357319680) - Post Recap coming soon
4. Log every 30 minutes of my life on Twitter
5. Auto delete all my tweets after one week
6. Grow an instagram account to 10k followers using fake quotes
7. Make an [alarm](/us-election) that rang when Biden won the elections

Not many other experiments come to my mind. But I surely did 10x more.
