VCs do everything you would expect the URSS would do, while being a private company.

### VC

Financing projects without asking too many questions. Sometimes people refer to this as *VC welfare*.
If a company puts the right combination of *"disruptive", "blockchain" and "AI" in their slides* they receive funding.
Showing some *APIs, an app with users (real or fake)* the money flows him.

**With no real technical evaluation.**

### URSS

Financing projects without asking too many questions. Sometimes people refer to this as *Social welfare*.
If a company puts the right combination of *"surplus", "proletarians" in their presentations* they receive funding.
Showing some *building, a product and have employees (working or not)* the money flows him.

**With no real technical evaluation.**

### VC

**They gain ownership forcibly.**
In exchange for money, for the bet they gain equity (this doesn't always have to happen, when a bank gives you credit it doesn't become a partner).
In this way if the *company* becomes *a "Unicorn"*, the *equity value increases so much* that it covers the losses from the other failed *startups*, that got money, but failed.

### URSS

**They gain ownership forcibly.**
In exchange for money, for the bet they gain equity (this doesn't always have to happen, when a bank gives you credit it doesn't become a partner).
In this way if the *factory* becomes *an "Example for the nation"*, the **five year plan would increase so much in value* that it covers the losses from the other failed *factories*, that got money, but failed.

### VC

After this financing operation the *VC* doesn't check their investment too much.
They just follow the *Blog* for announcements, but not really understanding what the *startup* is really about they set a time frame for the investment to generate "returns" or *either exit or go public* in case of success.

### URSS

After this financing operation the *State* doesn't check their investment too much.
They just follow the *Public Commisar* for announcements, but not really understanding what the *factory* is really about they set a time frame for the investment to generate "returns" or become an *example for the country* in case of success.

### VC

There is no evalutation of the technological value of a project, not even of its feasability.
*Theranos,* for example promised something that anyone that has spent 5 minutes in *medical research* lab would find impossible. The results were fake. But no one really experimented the technology with indipendent scientists BEFORE investing. And also when researchers talked, they were ignored.

### URSS

There is no evalutation of the technological value of a project, not even of its feasability.
*Lysenko,* for example promised something that anyone that has spent 5 minutes in a *agrarian biology* lab would find impossible. The results were fake. But no one really experimented the technology with indipendent scientists BEFORE investing. And also when researchers talked, they were ignored.

### VC

No one looks at the CV of the founder of a *Startup*. Neither the industry or academic experience count. It's not particularly important to have worked in similar companies or the degree. What counts is being part of *"the Silicon Valley culture"*, even a disastrous past is ignored because of a positive "failure culture", the idea that a failure is testimony of *courage and of a risk taking attitude.*

### URSS

No one looks at the CV of the founder of a *factory*. Neither the industry or academic experience count. It's not particularly important to have worked in similar companies or the degree. What counts is being part of *"the Communist ideology"*, even a disastrous past is ignored because of a positive "failure culture", the idea that a failure is testimony of *heroism and trust in the Communist system.*
