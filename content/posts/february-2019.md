I want to do many things. Waaay too many.

So I told myself I have to prioritize. Writing is a good way for me to think, so I decided to make this decision making process transparent and open.

If I were sitting in a bar in the right context, I'd talk about all this freely. So why not write a blog post about this.

## Step 1 - Brain Data Dump

### What I want to do

* Write Blog Posts and Newsletter
* Work for [Creators Never Die](https://creatorsneverdie.com)
* Study and Practice for exams
* Learn more LeetCode and Clojure
* Prepare my ClojureD Talk
* Workout 3 times a week
* Hang out with friends - Social Life
* Study more about workouts
* Learn more Swift making an App
* Learn React Hooks
* Travel to South America
* Travel to SF and meet some internet friends
* Start a profitable Saas product
* Improve [KIT](https://kit) 

### Why?

**Write Blog Posts and Newsletter**

Building a knowledge base of what I learned over the years and thinking helps me improve as a person.

As a bonus I also grow the amount of people I get in touch with. I'm extremely social, so this is really good for me.

**Work for [Creators Never Die](https://creatorsneverdie.com)**

We're working on things that excite me. Shipping products, writing Documentation and Blog Posts are all things I enjoy.

**Study and Practice for exams**

Long term having a degree is going to be useful for me. Whether if it's to apply for a VISA or a job I think it's worth it to have one.

I'm also extremely against not finishing what I start. So I have to get this done.

In the past year I focused too much on making products and working, so I didn't study much. I'm happy I learned Clojure, Dev Ops and the full JS stack. 

But my degree is in Control Engineering, so I don't really need any of this in my exams.

I have to focus for the next couple of months and get it done, so I can start traveling while working remotely.

**Learn more LeetCode and Clojure**

I want to be able to ace any technical interviews in the future. So as on the day to day coding I don't really have to deal with the things they ask you in these interviews I have to start doing the LeetCode challenges on my own.

To get to a FAANG level of confidence will likely take me 3-4 months of practice a couple of hours a day.

I also want to improve as a Clojure developer and maybe write some open source libraries.

**Prepare my ClojureD Talk**

I already plotted out all the talk, prepared the outline and repeated it once.

I have to practice more and make the Keynote slides for it.

Probably going to take me 3-4 hours to get the presention done and 5-6 hours to repeat it.

**Workout 3 times a week**

I find that if I don't work out three times a week I feel down.

It's like the world crumbles down on me and I feel like not doing anything vaguely productive.

It's also a negative spiral that can hunt me for prolonged periods. It's imperative for me to keep my physical and mental cool. Working out, staying hydrated and not skipping meals.

**Hang Out with friends**

If I don't spend time going out with friends, dating a little and having fun doing social activities I might as well become a robot.

So I have to find a way to balance everything. Talking shit at the gym, having lunch with friends, going out a couple of days a week and watching Inter Milan's games.

**Study More About Workouts**

I don't know much about what I'm doing at the gym.

I understand the groups I'm training and I have a trainer that helps me out planning what I should do and fixing my posture.

I'd really want to learn more though.

**Learn more Swift making an App**

I'd really like to make an iOS app. I hacked together a really simple Mac OS menu bar app for [klipped.in](https://klipped.in) in a couple of hours a while back. Making apps seems cool, maybe I should learn more about it.

**Learn React Hooks**

Haven't learned those yet as they weren't in the "stable" React release yet. Have to find a couple of hours to figure those out and play around.


**Travel to South America**

This sounds like something fun that I've been wanting to do for a while.

**Travel to SF and meet some internet friends**

This is higher priority and likely going to happen in the summer. I might spend August in SF and go to Burning Man ðŸ”¥.

**Start a profitable Saas product**

This is a long term goal. Right now by working I'm improving my skills to build and design one. By hanging out with friends and Blogging I'm trying to figure out ideas and getting to know people, which might become good partners.

**Improve [KIT](https://kit)** 

This is my second revenue stream. I should probably work on improving it as it's making me money and it seems like a good idea to double down on what's working.


## Step 2 - Marie Kondo on my Life

If I could do just two things I'd chose **Study** and **Work**.

One is for the long term and one is for the short term, so that's a good balance.

Staying healthy and having a social life can be done at the same time.

And I'll finish preparing the talk as it's almost done and I can try it out a couple of times when meeting up with some techie friends willing to listen to me!

The rest is postponed until further notice!

## Step 3 - Results

It would be easy to get the dopamine hit of "having done something" posting this.

So to make this harder for me I'll write this step as the month ends, summing up what worked and what didn't.

Instead of having a call to action for myself I'll have already taken action.
