Software at Scale

How teams build software at different scales

An engineer's quest to find the right company size

What's your company size? 

The best proxy to understand what kind of work a software engineer will do is company size.

So before looking for work opportunities ICs have to understand where they belong.

Not doing this will result in getting positions that aren't a good fit. 

Leading to bad morale, poor performance or unhappiness.

There aren't many resources to figure out what to expect from positions, so I decided to put together a guide.

Teams

Let's start small.

The smallest unit in an organisation is an Individual Contributor (IC).

Around 7-10 ICs can communicate and work together without needing much coordination.

When you reach the 10-16 people mark its starts to get a bit harder to have in mind what each person is doing.

At this point teams are split in groups, with managers, that start reporting to C-Level.

The next level

As soon as you have 8-10 Managers it becomes harder for leadership to understand what's going on.

So another layer gets introduced.

Here's a table showing all the different "critical points".

| ðŸ“¦  Size Name     |  | ðŸ‘¥  Employee Count |  | ðŸ•¸  Number of Layers  |
| :-------------:|---|:-------------: |---| :----------------------:|
| Solo   ||  1-8  ||  1 |
| Small  || 8-64 || 2 |
| Medium  || 64-512 || 3 |
| Large || 512-4096 || 4  |
|  Mega Corp ||   4096-32768  ||  5  |


At each point we add a new layer of bureaucracy.

In scaleup phase:

French startups

Engineer entered for most Saas companies

Sales first orgs engineers would just crunch through work

Planning

40 engineers in Saas companies

Mostly flat, but you have some tech leads

Engineers specialized on specific features already

Not many meetings at this stage, not many designers. PM was doing most of design. Freelance designer and using it 1-2 years without hiring someone else.

After 50-60 engineers, one real designer

Getting one design system and using it forever

Collaboration between engineers

Spotify model (squads) group of people working on the same stuff

2-3 years ago Netflix started mixing teams with Design / PM and Sales. Each team is like a small startup

In Paris startups are not doing this yet.

Not much planning, whatever it takes to finish this feature, weâ€™ll do.

Not really thinking about of career, but not too consciously. Youâ€™re taking a bet!

200 eng

A lot more meetings. Problems max 5 designers, you need to wait for designers to be available. Resource allocation becomes a problem.

You start having hierarchies, between developers.

More structure for work. You donâ€™t have as much freedom.

1 tech lead, 1 em , 2-3 eng, product manager (no designer)

Performance reviews vary a lot among different styles of companies

Transparently giving a raise to people

Other companies to grades. What do you want to do to the next level

This is a checklist of things you have to prove youâ€™re able to do.

What we really need and just do the minimal work necessary

 

Communication is always bad at a large scale

1 manager 1 SW + shared PM

7 eng 

2 PR a year

10 people 1 EM
