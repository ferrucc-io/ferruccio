## An engineer's quest to find the right company size

The best proxy to understand what kind of work a software engineer will do is company size.

So before looking for work opportunities it's worth spending time understanding where does one belong.

Not doing this will result in getting positions that aren't a good fit. 

Leading to bad morale, poor performance or unhappiness.

There aren't many resources to figure out what to expect from positions, so I decided to put together a guide.

## Teams

Let's start small.

The smallest unit in an organisation is an Individual Contributor (IC).

Around 7-10 ICs can communicate and work together without needing much coordination.

When you reach the 10-16 people mark its starts to get a bit harder to have in mind what each person is doing.

At this point teams are split in groups, with managers, that start reporting to C-Level.

### The next level

As soon as you have 8-10 Managers it becomes harder for leadership to understand what's going on.

So another layer gets introduced.

Every time an organization adds a layer, we have a *critical point*.

Here's a table showing a breakdown of when this happens:

| ðŸ“¦  Size Name     |  | ðŸ‘¥  Employee Count |  | ðŸ•¸  Number of Layers  |
| :-------------:|---|:-------------: |---| :----------------------:|
| Solo   ||  1-8  ||  1 |
| Small Enterprise  || 8-64 || 2 |
| Mid Market Enterprise  || 64-512 || 3 |
| Large Enterprise || 512-4096 || 4  |
|  Mega Corp ||   4096-32768  ||  5  |


At each point we add a new layer of bureaucracy.

# Solo

I have some experience in early stage companies and wrote a [blog post](/altacucina) about my most recent one.

Here is the best part of it:

* Direct Communication with the leaders
* You go from idea to feature in a couple of hours
* No one thinks about career or anything like that, if the company succeeds you know you'll do alright
* No part of the development process is not your responsibility

Here are the worst things:

* You lose track of time because of work (forget meals, sleep and physical activity). Every hour of every day is work.
* You don't have much guidance or someone to look up to (which is also a good thing)
* It's quite stressful

add X experience of someone else

## Small Enterprise

I don't have direct experience with companies of this size, but talked with Jean Elie about this and these are some key notes from our conversation on ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· French startups.

The organization is mostly flat, but you have some tech leads.


## Mid Market Enterprise

In scaleup phase:

French startups

Engineer entered for most Saas companies

Sales first orgs engineers would crunch through work

Planning

40 engineers in Saas companies

Mostly flat, but you have some tech leads

Engineers specialized on specific features already

Few meetings at this stage. Designers are generally a scarce resource at this point. 

PMs did most of design. The company hired a freelance designer . 

Kept using his work and design system 1-2 years without hiring someone else.

After 50-60 engineers, they finally hired one real designer

Collaboration between engineers

2-3 years ago Netflix started mixing teams with Design / PM and Sales. Each team is like a small startup

In Paris startups are not doing this yet.

Not much planning, whatever it takes to finish this feature, weâ€™ll do.

Not really thinking about of career, but not too consciously. Youâ€™re taking a bet!

200 eng

A lot more meetings. Problems max 5 designers, you need to wait for designers to be available. Resource allocation becomes a problem.

You start having hierarchies, between developers.

More structure for work. You donâ€™t have as much freedom.

1 tech lead, 1 em , 2-3 eng, product manager (no designer)

Performance reviews vary a lot among different styles of companies

Transparently giving a raise to people

Other companies to grades. What do you want to do to the next level

This is a checklist of things you have to prove youâ€™re able to do.
