One thing I never liked of writing on this site is not having a nice editor to be able to write content.

Also now that AI has taken over most coding editors it's annoying to have to deal with autocomplete and tab.

When I write my thoughts I don't want AI to get in the way.

So today I decided to build a small web server with an editor that I can use to edit my articles.

The main pain points I wanted to address were:

- Easy article creation
- Have a fast way to edit any old posts
- A distraction free editor
- Have the ability to just drag into the page any media assets and put them in the right folder
- Create a writing playground that feels personal and fun to use


Now I just need to see whether this helps me keep writing more articles regularly.

This is the first post I'm writing using my new editor, if it sticks I'd love to abstract it and turn it into something other people can use too! One candidate application is my [changelog repo](https://github.com/juneHQ/changelog)

Thanks for reading, in the coming weeks I'll be writing more.

**Update 07/06/2025:** I just changed the build system of the blog to run on GitHub actions. The build process and making changes should be much smoother now.
