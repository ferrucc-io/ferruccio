This is the world in the eyes of a dog

The poor things have such a cold experience of the world. Our eyes while giving us a richer experience of the world are also a limited mechanical tool.

The world doesn't care though. It stays the same regardless of the tools we use to perceive it - whether it's the eyes of a dog or my presbyc ones.

This sounds like stoner talk, but hear me out.

The things you spend a lot of time thinking about are the tools you use to understand the world.

You spent a lot of energy to find an answer to a question, so you recycle the same thoughts to get another answer.

Your ideas are only a remix of the data you collected.

Different subjects have different ways of organizing information and to come up with answers.

**These ways of organizing information are the eyes we use to see the world.**

Here are some of the eyes I've seen, of my own or of people in my life:

*   **Biology** - Every behaviour is an evolutionary need
*   **Physics** - Everything follows the laws of physics, even memes
*   **Control Theory** - Everything is a control system - Inputs turn into outputs. Actuator use feedback loops to figure out what buttons to press to get a desired output.
*   **Computer Science** - Life is like a software someone else wrote that you get to understand only by bug fixing and extending.
*   **Statistics** - Black Swan events
*   **Politics** - Everything happens because of a law or a government program, going to the moon, the internet and freedom
*   **History** - Humans never change and our behaviours keep repeating. Learn what happened to figure out what's next
*   **Culture** - Human progress comes from the culture of the times. Illuminism enabled the Scientific Method
*   And so on..

Cynics would say that these eyes are people trying to come up with a higher meaning for what their lives.

But there's an opportunity in this.

Learning about all these eyes we can discover the different shapes and colors of the human experience
