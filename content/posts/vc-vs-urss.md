VCs do everything you expect a URSS government would do, while being a private company.

### VC

Financing projects without asking too many questions. Sometimes people refer to this as *VC welfare*.
If a company puts the right combination of *"disruptive", "blockchain" and "AI" in their slides* they receive funding.
Showing some *APIs, an app with users (real or fake)* the money flows him.

**With no real technical evaluation.**

### URSS

Financing projects without asking too many questions. Sometimes people refer to this as *Social welfare*.
If a company puts the right combination of *"surplus", "proletarians" in their presentations* they receive funding.
Showing some *building, a product and have employees (working or not)* the money flows him.

**With no real technical evaluation.**

### VC

**They gain ownership forcibly.**
In exchange for money, for the bet they gain equity (this doesn't always have to happen, when a bank gives you credit it doesn't become a partner).
In this way if the *company* becomes * a "Unicorn"*, the equity values increases so much that it covers the losses from the other failed *startup*s, that got money, but failed.

### URSS

**They gain ownership forcibly.**
In exchange for money, for the bet they gain equity (this doesn't always have to happen, when a bank gives you credit it doesn't become a partner).
In this way if the *factory* becomes *an "Example for the nation"*, the **five year plan would increase so much in value* that it covers the losses from the other failed *factories*, that got money, but failed.
