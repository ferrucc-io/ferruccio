I've been blogging for almost 10 years and what I've written on the internet has reached millions of people.

Most of what I've written is in Italian, but I was also mildly successful with my Quora profile, reaching 400k people in three months.

## üëò  I'm now opening up the kimono
#### Here's all I know about Blogging.

* No one has time to read your article, write the first lines like they're a TLDR.
* The design of your site is irrelevant.
* To start out you don't need any software.
* Define your audience.
* Figure out where your audience is.
* For SEO don't write short articles (>2000 words) for Social Media keep your articles shorter
* One well researched article is better than a lot of mediocre content
* Spend half of the time writing, half promoting.
* Spend 50% of the writing time actually writing, the rest tweaking, reading and illustrating. Details are important.
* Spill all your secrets. **Don't be worried about the fact that you'll run out of content, you won't.**
* There are no rules, slowly craft your unique style.
* Go back in your old posts and link them to newer ones.
* Start a Newsletter.


What is hard, but valuable is carefully crafting something timeless that really penetrates your readers minds.

The power of writing is that it's a drug.

You'll know you're doing it right, when you'll have people refreshing the content of your website every day to check if you've posted something new.

You're doing it right if you get messages thanking you for what you wrote. Once you get unsolicited messages like: 

> "This was illuminating, it opened up a world of possibilities in my mind." 

> "I've always thought this, but didn't have the courage to write it down, thanks for doing it."

> "Your words made me finally what's the big deal about X, thanks"

If your goal is to get to this point then this article is all you need.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Audience

**The first step** when starting out a blog is figuring out who's your audience.
Most people I know skip this step, but it's essential. It's easy to blurt out some words and sharing them on your social media.

To explain how to do this I'll show you how I'm doing it right now for my personal blog.

Up until now I used this blog to help me think, but for the new year I decided to treat it more seriously.

**So what is my audience?**

If you're starting a blog for your company you have to see who your customers generally are, or which customers would be your ideal audience and cater to them.

In my case this is a personal blog and my goal is to meet people like me.

Here's a description of who my realistic reader:

> *Your name is Vincent, you are a 30yo generalist from France, you don't work long hours for your day job. You've spent some time working remotely, but are now stable in the US. You've started more projects than you can count, and some were successful. You're interested in anything that is not ordinary and you are a contrarian by nature. You don't shy away from an argument and never get offended. You aren't really interested in retiring, you're more interested in experimenting than anything else. Some people perceive you as a bit of a dick you couldn't care less.*

Once you defined your audience you have ~~to figure out if it's large enough.~~

**No, it's the internet, don't worry about it it's big enough.**

In fact if it seems big enough for you, I'd consider to niche down.

## üìå The name

Next step is to **pick a name**, it's not important, just make sure it's something you like and that it's not too generic or impossible to remember. Don't spend more than a day on this and once you find a name sleep at least one night over it before settling for it.

In my case I picked my name Ferruccio as the domain name, because my name is extremely rare and I already owned the domain [ferrucc.io](https://ferrucc.io). 

The downside is that Americans have no clue on how to say it, but I'm okay with this. It's certainly easier to remember than certain Indian names (üßê talking about you Chamath Palihapitiya).

## üíÖ The Style

The style of your blog doesn't really count too much at the beginning.

Your writing style on the other hand makes all the difference.

Depending on who your audience is you have to adjust the tone of your conversation.

For example as I picked someone much older and experienced then me as a target audience it would make no sense if I had a "know it all" tone. My audience isn't native english speakers so I won't be complicating my language and I'll limit my vocabulary in an effort to be as clear and accessible as possible.

If you really want to make something unique you can have custom illustrations in your style. Having a coherent style for illustrations in your blog can be something that makes people remember about you.

Other than big corporate blogs [Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/) does this very well.

If you are bad at drawing learn how to use something like [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

I'm still coming up with a design style for the illustrations on this website, but I think it's going to be something like this:

![](/starting-a-blog/chat.png)
![](/starting-a-blog/tree.png)

I'm a little obsessed with design, so if you have no design skills feel free to keep everything simple sticking with text content. 

Here are some ugly blogs with great content: 

* [Paul Graham's Blog](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
* [Patio11's Blog](https://www.kalzumeus.com/)
* [Derek Sivers's Blog](https://sivers.org/)

It's not really important to have any illustrations, but the fact that I can make them and express my messages visually helps me stand out.
