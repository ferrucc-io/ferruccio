I think one of the most interesting mental exercises one can do is exploring the history of aesthetics.

Human aesthetics and symbols change over time in ways that reflect progress.

People got bored of Greek tragedy? Chubby people became unattractive, people started liking squares on a canvas.

But there was a moment when Dante's books were considered good. When Marx's ideas were considered interesting.

Looking at the history of aesthetic is spying on the slow movement of human desires.

Most movements are slow, but sometimes we take a leap. These leaps are the most interesting thing we can observe.


Illuminism took a thousand years
French revolution a couple of years
Impressionism took some years
Berlin wall was one day
Internet took 10 years

We went from Proust to Celine in just a couple of years.

## Fosbury's Jump

Fosbury
Finding the right way to jump

There's a technological change that comes first, in the Fosbury case it's not falling on sand anymore.

It's an illogical first step

When a human is shocked, the reaction is first saying it's illogical -> (it's dangerous) -> ()

A way of looking at the world is broken and against all logic a new world is unlocked, and everyone flocks to it.

In 10 days all jumpers doing things the old way started looking prehistoric, like they belonged to a different species.

## Why does this happen?

Every movement is caused by many different things that change at the same time. So it depends.

## Kate Moss

In the beginning on the 90s beauty standards were quite standard.

The most famous models were 4-5, always in the same poses and in the same kind of photos. Same face, perfect teeth, same haircuts, same make up, same bodies.

Lighting is used to enhance the subject's beauty.

Most importantly they all represented this same idea of glamour.

Here are some examples of covers from magazines in 1990.

[put magazine covers 1990]

In June 1990, a hip magazine called "The Face", published this cover:

```
Kate Moss - June
```

She's skinny, but not in a glamourous way.

Smoking, sitting on the floor with the sun in her face.
Struggling to keep her eyes open, fighting with the light.
Messy hair, no makeup.

This is the illogical next step.

This is not something you should look with the eyes of someone that has spent 10 minutes on Instagram.

You should look at this with the eyes of someone that had seen X for 10 years:

Calvin Klein -> Mario Sorrenti photoshoot, obsession

Within 3 years, the Kate Moss you see on "The Face" was polished a bit and became the mainstream aesthetic.

Beauty shifted from women looking like Barbies to broke students standing next to a radiator.
