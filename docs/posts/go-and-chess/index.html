<p>Let&rsquo;s start with two photos:</p>
<p><img src="/go-and-chess/chess.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/go-and-chess/go.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Who won?</p>
<p>Try and guess who won in the two games.</p>
<p>In the first picture, even if you don&rsquo;t understand the game you can guess who won.</p>
<p>You can tell that the white is smashing the black into a corner.</p>
<p>And has more pieces in play.</p>
<p>Chess is a game based on domination.</p>
<p>It’s zero sum, kill or be killed.</p>
<p>There are correct moves and strategies. The chess board is simple enough to fit in your brain.</p>
<p>If you want you can play a chess game without a board.</p>
<p>At most you have to remember what&rsquo;s on 32 cells, the rest are always empty.</p>
<p>Go is a game of erosion and nuance.</p>
<p>A board would hardly fit in your mind as there are 361 cells.</p>
<p>For every move there are so many options that the best players win by intuition and not by wit or calculation.</p>
<p>The conflict takes place in disconnected parts of the board.</p>
<p>Sacrifices for tactical positioning don&rsquo;t happen just in the initial part of the game.</p>
<p>A game is not a battle, but a war. Where little wins here and there only count in the aggregate.</p>
<p>Board games have a deeper impact than you&rsquo;d imagine.</p>
<p>They have effect on how people think about conflict.</p>
<p>Politics are conflict and compromise.</p>
<p>The way China thinks about conflict in fact is very similar to the game of Go.</p>
<p>Wei qi (Go) is the game of encirclement.</p>
<p>Chinese foreign policy takes inspiration from this.</p>
<p>An example of its strategies taken to the real world is their dealings with Taiwan.</p>
<p>A country that is being taken over through sheer diplomacy and economic policy.</p>
<p><img src="/go-and-chess/taiwan.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This photo pretty much explains itself.</p>
<p>Today there are only 15 countries that have full diplomatic relations with Taiwan:</p>
<p><img src="/go-and-chess/country-list.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When China started investing more heavily in Australia (1972), the Australian government, officially a US ally, made an announcement.</p>
<p>For matters regarding Taiwan they wouldn’t be automatically be partners with the US.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Relations_Act">1979</a> the US stopped official diplomatic relationships with Taiwan.</p>
<p>Today any country that recognizes Taiwan automatically ends their diplomatic relations with China.</p>
<p>So Taiwan finds itself..</p>
<p>Slowly encircled!</p>
<p><strong>Modern wars don&rsquo;t have the concept of total victory.</strong></p>
<p>But this is as close as you can get from it.</p>
<p>In a Go game, like in the real world, the current state of things is blurry. Until it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>War and foreign politics look a lot like Go.</p>
<p>In the sense that a winning approach is probabilistic.</p>
<p>The determinism of Chess makes it a bad metaphor of the real world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to stop thinking about conflict as chess.</p>
<p>If you think can get rid of your opponents by getting heads on into a clash, you can&rsquo;t win at modern foreign politics.</p>
<p>As Kissinger says in his book &ldquo;On China&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Chess produces single-mindedness; wei qi generates strategic flexibility.”</p>
</blockquote>
