<p>June allows you to add dynamic traits to your users. For example, if you want to run an analysis only on users that are on your <strong>pro plan</strong>, you can do that by adding a &ldquo;plan&rdquo; trait to your users.</p>
<p><strong>The value of these properties is mutable and has no relationship with time. We&rsquo;re thinking about making it immutable.</strong></p>
<p>Since we added this feature, we haven&rsquo;t entirely made our minds about this compromise.</p>
<p>This problem comes up for many companies. Here&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;re thinking about it.</p>
<h2 id="our-current-data-model-mutable">Our current data model (mutable)</h2>
<p>Users table</p>
<ul>
<li>app_id</li>
<li>id</li>
<li>user_id (from Segment)</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>traits</li>
<li>updated_at</li>
</ul>
<p>The traits field is a JSON that gets updated with new data any time one user sends us an identify call.</p>
<p>This data structure works as expected most of the time, but there are a few odd behaviors it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you update the value of a trait, the results of historical analyses change</li>
<li>If you update the value of a trait, we lose the historical values that it had in the past</li>
<li>Analytics databases have poor support for updating data, as they encourage keeping data immutable</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="counting-active-users-on-the-pro-plan-case-a">Counting active users on the pro plan (Case A)</h2>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of unexpected behavior you get from modeling data this way:</p>
<p>I want to know the number of active users on a Pro plan month by month for the last year to see how it changed over time. We can count users with a &ldquo;Pro plan&rdquo; trait that were active each month. If some users from 1 year ago churned and aren&rsquo;t on the pro plan anymore, the graph would not include them.</p>
<p>This happens because the users&rsquo; traits data is mutable, meaning it can change.</p>
<h2 id="an-immutable-alternative">An immutable alternative</h2>
<p>We can model data in an immutable way to handle this edge case.</p>
<p>Identify logs table</p>
<ul>
<li>app_id</li>
<li>timestamp</li>
<li>user_id</li>
<li>traits</li>
<li>email</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when we run analytical queries, we can select users with a specific trait in our analysis interval.</p>
<p>So any time we run the Case A analyses, we get the same (and correct) results.</p>
<p>We also have access to all historical changes to run queries flattening data in the same way as we&rsquo;re doing it with the mutable models.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new problem, though. There&rsquo;s now more complexity that we need to expose to our users, and the effect of this can be very counterintuitive.</p>
<p>For example, it&rsquo;s good practice for companies to measure sign-ups by job title.</p>
<p>After signing up, you ask users their role in the company. You then want to use this data to make a chart with sign-ups by position.</p>
<p>If we try and do this using the traits we had at the moment users signed up, we&rsquo;d get no results. If we run this same analysis on the sum of all the traits we ever received, we&rsquo;d get the right results. So when defining rules to segment an audience, instead of saying &ldquo;Users on the pro plan&rdquo; we need to specify when they were on the pro plan, is it now, or at the time they performed an event?</p>
<p>This example shows how being technically correct sometimes adds friction and confusion to the experience.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this approach&rsquo;s benefit is that it helps you partition data more efficiently.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you partition the users&rsquo; data by time instead of scanning through all your users to find your analyses&rsquo; audience. In that case, you can only look at the active users at the time of your analysis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p><strong>So the open question for us is how we should model user data?</strong></p>
<p>Tools like Mixpanel go with the mutable approach.</p>
<p>Amplitude instead goes with the immutable approach, with no option to &ldquo;flatten&rdquo; all historical data.</p>
<p>When exporting data to a warehouse, segmentation also stores it in an immutable way.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet">parquet</a> file of user data that Segment saves to S3 looks like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>s3://&lt;top-level-Segment-bucket&gt;/data/&lt;source-id&gt;/segment_type=identify/day=&lt;YYYY-MM-DD&gt;/hr=&lt;HH&gt;
