<p>The best things that happened in my life happened through communities on the internet.</p>
<p>Here’s a story of all the places I hanged out on the internet and made friends from.</p>
<hr>
<p>Until the first year of high school I’ve been offline. </p>
<p>My experience until then with the internet was running a Blogspot to sell snacks in middle school (with someone who&rsquo;s still one of my best friends) and having a messenger account on my dad’s computer.</p>
<p>Everything changed in my first year of high school, when I discovered the internet (and porn) through my dad’s iPad.</p>
<h2 id="kingdoms-at-war">Kingdoms at war</h2>
<p>I started playing an online game called kingdoms at war. And through it I started chatting with strangers on the internet, my clan!</p>
<h2 id="xda-forum">XDA Forum</h2>
<p>In the first year of high school I got a Motorola phone with an outdated version of Android. This made me find XDA Forum and learn how to root my device.</p>
<p>Through the forum I got in touch with an indian developer that was building the modded firmware and started talking with him.</p>
<p>I also found some other italians with my same phone so I started a group chat with them.</p>
<h2 id="italian-edm-facebook">Italian EDM Facebook</h2>
<p>Second year of high school I got interested in EDM music. I got my first computer too.</p>
<p>I got into Facebook and as no one liked my posts I started adding to my friends Italian DJs making EDM. I became close with <a href="https://lu.linkedin.com/in/federicogiusto">Federico</a> a friend of my older cousin, that lived in Luxembourg and produced music.</p>
<p>Through Federico I started chatting with <a href="https://it.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/andreatine">Andrea</a> a Sicilian hacker and fellow EDM fan.</p>
<p>After one week that we knew each other online I told him that I wanted to be in the music business. I also told him I was shit at both making music and designing artworks so there wasn’t an obvious space for me.</p>
<p>Andrea told me that people that don’t know how to do anything become journalists.</p>
<p>Andrea then bought edmnews.it so that we could start a wordpress blog on it. We agreed that he would buy the server and set it up, and that we&rsquo;d be a 50/50 partnership writing together.</p>
<p>He also created an email for me: <a href="mailto:ferruccio@edmnews.it">ferruccio@edmnews.it</a> </p>
<p>At the time an email with a custom domain was enough to make any teen sound legitimate to major labels, festivals and artists.</p>
<p>I made hundreds internet friends through that blog, and met <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kharfi">Davide</a> in real life.</p>
<p>He was the first internet friend that I met IRL</p>
<p>After a year of EDM I started to grow out of it. Started listening to techno music and other stuff.</p>
<p>Puberty and facebook likes gave me a boost in self confidence. So my energies moved to dating.</p>
<p>I still kept meeting up friends from the EDM Facebook groups though.</p>
<p>For example when I got my first job selling Ice Cream in London one of my only friends there was Tommaso, a guy I met from an Italian EDM group.</p>
<h2 id="instagram">Instagram</h2>
<p>Fast forward to my first year of college I learned how to code. I started running an Instagram bot for an Italian personal growth blog of my own. Once I reached 10-15k instagram followers I started meeting other people that were trying to find growth hacks.</p>
<p>Through instagram influencer comment exchange groups I met <a href="https://riccardosuardi.com/">Riccardo</a> who at the time was also starting a blog.</p>
<h2 id="my-personal-blog">My personal Blog</h2>
<p>Until this point most of the things I had published on the internet were in Italian.</p>
<p>I created a Medium profile and started writing 250 words a day in english.</p>
<p>Then I bought the ferrucc.io domain and started owning my digital presence.</p>
<p>The initial version of the blog had a <a href="https://sivers.org/nowff">/now</a> page that sent me most of my traffic. With just that I managed to start receiving emails and making friends with some interesting people (like <a href="https://www.dkthehuman.com/about/">DK</a>).</p>
<h2 id="quora">Quora</h2>
<p>Around a year after this I stopped using Instagram and started a Quora profile with the goal of reaching 365k views in less than a year. Through answering questions I started meeting people in other communities.</p>
<p>The weirdest one became my mentor. My internet grandpa was an 80 year old entrepreneur. Grandpa was a bit of an anarchist Hugh Hefner. We bonded over despising governments and taxes.</p>
<h2 id="twitter">Twitter</h2>
<p>Because of the crypto craze I got into Twitter. After spending some time leeching I started posting things to make some friends.</p>
<p>After 6 months or so I started following and interacting with everyone that had a side project. Over a year or so I started meeting more and more people.</p>
<p>I even started doing some freelance gigs for twitter friends on the other side of the globe.</p>
<p>Then I decided to organize a dinner with every maker I could find in Milan. And that’s how I met a group of 5-6 friends that I still talk to!</p>
<p>Through these dinners I also met <a href="https://twitter.com/SimoneMascagni">Simone</a>, and that’s how my <a href="/posts/altacucina">Al.ta Cucina</a> adventure started.</p>
<p>Most of my closest friends now come from Twitter.</p>
<p>Anytime I go to a city I tweet it out and get to meet people that like me and have similar interests.</p>
<h2 id="makerlog--product-hunt">Makerlog &amp; Product Hunt</h2>
<p>As soon as I got involved with the maker community I started making my own small products too.</p>
<p>I first interacted with <a href="https://twitter.com/anthilemoon">Anne-Laure</a> because we were launching a product on the same day.</p>
<p>I connected with around a hundred people through these sites, mostly in Twitter DMs and Telegram chats.</p>
<h2 id="pioneer">Pioneer</h2>
<p>Another internet community that made me meet some interesting people is Pioneer.</p>
<p>Through Pioneer I met ambitious people around my age tying to change the world!</p>
<p>If I wasn’t starting a company I’d want to join the <a href="https://buildatmos.com/">Atmos</a> team that I first met through Pioneer.</p>
<p>I think the person I met from Pioneer that I talk the most with is <a href="https://twitter.com/gansernathan">Nathan</a></p>
<h2 id="ambitious">Ambitious</h2>
<p>This was a short lived community on Discord.</p>
<p>The great thing it had was weekly conversations with some of the most inspiring people in tech. The idea was that every week a different guest got on a call with the community.</p>
<p>The guests on these calls ranged from Erik Torenberg, Alan Kay to Tyler Cowen.</p>
<p>Looking back the “podcast” that had the biggest impact on me was the one with <a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez">Riva Tez</a>. She has a viral energy, optimism and knows how to play!</p>
<h2 id="interintellect">Interintellect</h2>
<p>Interintellect is a community ran by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat">Anna Gat</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone in it is curious and likes to read books and make friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been in the Salons they organise. I had some great 1 on 1 conversations with people from their Slack community.</p>
<p>Hopefully when Covid is over I&rsquo;ll be able to organise attend an IRL Salon</p>
<h2 id="clubhouse">Clubhouse</h2>
<p>Clubhouse is great because of the mindset most people have while hopping into a room.</p>
<p>Everyone is very accessible and friendly on it, so it&rsquo;s great! I haven&rsquo;t been on it for long though and haven&rsquo;t made any long term friends on it yet.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&rsquo;s next?</h2>
<p>If you think I&rsquo;m a nice human, I&rsquo;d love to get to know you!</p>
<p><strong>I just moved to Paris 🇫🇷 and I&rsquo;d be happy to meet up with you and chat if you&rsquo;re here!</strong></p>
<p>If you can think about someone I&rsquo;d get along with feel free to introduce me to them!</p>
<p><em>Easiest way to get in touch with me is DMing on Twitter or emailing hi @ this domain</em></p>
