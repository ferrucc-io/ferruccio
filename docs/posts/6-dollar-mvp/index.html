<p>You can do this now, on my new website <a href="https://draftbunny.xyz">DraftBunny</a></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the story behind it.</p>
<h2 id="saturday-18pm">Saturday 18PM</h2>
<p>I get home after a day of studying for exams and come up with the idea of making a website for people with personal blogs to share their drafts to proofread one another.
Text the idea to Marco and he likes it, saying he would use it.</p>
<h2 id="saturday-1810pm">Saturday 18.10PM</h2>
<p>I start a Django project, set it up (repository and standard settings) and start creating the basic models for the database.</p>
<p>In about two hours, I had the first working version, with plain html:</p>
<ul>
<li>A form where anyone could post a link and a title, a button to submit.</li>
<li>A list of the most recent articles.</li>
<li>A link to a Telegram group to discuss with users what to build next.</li>
</ul>
<p>After making this I realize that I should probably let people create accounts and pages for articles so that everyone knows who is contributing and how.</p>
<h2 id="saturday-2108pm">Saturday 21.08PM</h2>
<p>I now send a message on the Solo Founders telegram group to get some feedback:</p>
<p><img src="/first-feedback.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now time to get a front end together.
At first I thought about just using bootstrap, but then started browsing to find a lightweight library to start from.</p>
<p>I found <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and used it to style the front end.
Probably it wasn&rsquo;t a smart decision as I spent more time than I wished I did on looking for class names, to style the pages.
Next time I&rsquo;ll probably use this library again as I learned it, but I should have probably sticked with bootstrap.</p>
<p>Now only three things were missing, name, logo and deployment.</p>
<p>After some brainstorming I came up with a logo:
<img src="/draftbunny.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While looking for a name I kept thinking about Bugs Bunny:</p>
<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:72%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/wPGhh1ZBFFNZe" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><br>
I came up with the name DraftBunny.
I found the domain draftbunny.xyz for 1$ on Namecheap and snagged it.
<p>I now needed hosting, so I asked some friends what services I could use.
I chose <a href="https://linode.com">Linode</a> because I wanted to learn how to deploy apps setting up things. (I only had experience with Google App Engine and AWS)</p>
<p>This turned out to be a dumb decision as it delayed launch until now, but I&rsquo;m glad I made the decision to learn something new.</p>
<h2 id="sunday-000am">Sunday 0:00AM</h2>
<p>So the MVP was ready, deployment and launch were the only two things missing, so I decided to call it a day and go to sleep.</p>
<p>In the next days I had a series of problems, like my ISP&rsquo;s firewall blocking ssh.
In around two hours of messing around with the server I managed to deploy the app with https (finding a bug in let&rsquo;s encrypt&rsquo;s certbot in the process).</p>
<h4 id="total-expenses-6">Total Expenses: 6$</h4>
<p><strong>1$ - Domain name</strong></p>
<p><strong>5$ - Linode Credit (got 10 extra for free)</strong></p>
