      One of the most interesting thought experiments one can do is exploring the history of aesthetics.
Human aesthetics and symbols change over time in ways that reflect progress.
How did people get bored of Greek tragedy? Why did chubby people become unattractive, when did people start liking squares on a canvas?
There was a moment when Dante's books were considered good. When realistic paintings like Church's Niagara were the pinnacle of art.

I like the idea of my site being a snapshot of my thoughts that I can point to people when having a discussion.
I don't like repeating the same arguments over and over.
So here are some of my thoughts on &ldquo;Socialised Healthcare&rdquo;[1] for wider exposure and future reference.
I'll start with 5 agreeable axioms and use them systematically to derive &ldquo;Healthcare should not be free&rdquo;

      Doing the nand2tetris course is an extremely enlightning experience into the world of computers.
The course starts from the simplest building block, the &ldquo;NAND&rdquo; operators and helps you step by step to building a modern, functioning computer, OS and tetris Game.
The NAnd block stands for Not And.
It takes two binary inputs, A and B and outputs true only if they both aren't true.
   A B Output     0 0 1   1 0    1 1 0   0 1 1    To derive the Not operation we have to find a way of using NAnd to have this output:

Who won?
Try and guess who won in the two games.
In the first picture, even if you don't understand the game you can guess who won.
You can tell that the white is smashing the black into a corner.
And has more pieces in play.
Chess is a game based on domination.

By default Gmail doesn't support email importing from a file.

The reason I suggest you use Outlook is that it supports a format called .

The way he talks makes him likable both on the left and on the right.

I found that every time I meet someone in person that codes professionally the discussion at a certain point moves to ‚ÄúWhat do you listen when you code?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is your favourite genre/artist?‚Äù.
Here's what developers from big cities in the 20-30 age group tend to listen.
