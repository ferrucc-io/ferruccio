      I set out to write this article by interviewing 40+ engineers at companies of all sizes.
  The main learning here was that organizational design and culture are a fascinating topic, and that they might be as important then company size when picking a job.
 Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re early in your Software Engineer career.
You&rsquo;re a competent programmer looking for a change in working environment.
You‚Äôve got 4 offers from four companies at different stages.

      How two board games shape the concept of conflict in the western world and China.
Let&rsquo;s start with two photos:
Who won?
Try and guess who won in the two games.
In the first picture, even if you don&rsquo;t understand the game you can guess who won.
You can tell that the white is smashing the black into a corner.
And has more pieces in play.
Chess is a game based on domination.

By default Gmail doesn&rsquo;t support email importing from a file.
So the first step we&rsquo;ll have to go through is creating an Outlook email account here:

After creating an Outlook account we need to import data into it.
The reason I suggest you use Outlook is that it supports a format called .

I also developed an instinct to spot trends.
Mostly to find opportunities, but also for fun.
So when I stumbled upon Andrew Yang. I listened to a couple of his interviews and realised his ideas are powerful and bipartisan.
The way he talks makes him likable both on the left and on the right.

I found that every time I meet someone in person that codes professionally the discussion at a certain point moves to ‚ÄúWhat do you listen when you code?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is your favourite genre/artist?‚Äù.
Here&rsquo;s what developers from big cities in the 20-30 age group tend to listen.

      6 years ago this video came out.
  At the time I couldn‚Äôt code yet.
This concept is still mind blowing to me.
Up until now I always thought about code as a collection of files, connected through imports.
But really we import functions, not files.
We use files to store code because they&rsquo;re a convenient way to serialize code. They&rsquo;re not the best representation, in fact functions might provide a better one.

So let&rsquo;s go back a hundred years to get some inspiration.
Inspiration from the 1920s After selling 100 million books of his series Little Blue Book marketer Julius Hadleman wrote a book analysing all the data he had collected.
The book title is &ldquo;The First Hundred Million&rdquo; and it came out in 1928 (email me if you need help finding it) and features an interesting collection of proven Titles that work and insights on what we&rsquo;re interested in reading.
