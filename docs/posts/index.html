      Most founders in tech will tell you that they're a contrarian
But is being a contrarian an optimal decision? What are the alternatives? Is being a contrarian an advantage?
Founders of high growth companies, are making one big high risk high reward bet.
If you're looking for a big win you first have to find something that has high uncertainty.
For example, there's high uncertainty around when VR will become mainstream.

      The ability to make friendships through your passions is the best super power that the internet gives us.
The best things that happened in my life happened through communities on the internet.
Here’s a story of all the places I hanged out on the internet and made friends from.
 Until the first year of high school I’ve been offline. My experience until then with the internet was running a Blogspot to sell snacks in middle school (with someone who's still one of my best friends) and having a messenger account on my dad’s computer.

      One of the most interesting thought experiments one can do is exploring the history of aesthetics.
Human aesthetics change over time in ways that reflect progress.
How did people get bored of Greek tragedy? Why did chubby people become unattractive, when did people start liking squares on a canvas?
There was a moment when Dante's books were considered good. When realistic paintings like Church's Niagara were the pinnacle of art.

I like the idea of my site being a snapshot of my thoughts that I can point to people when having a discussion.
I don't like repeating the same arguments over and over.
So here are some of my thoughts on &ldquo;Socialised Healthcare&rdquo;[1] for wider exposure and future reference.
I'll start with 5 agreeable axioms and use them systematically to derive &ldquo;Healthcare should not be free&rdquo;

The course starts from the simplest building block, the &ldquo;NAND&rdquo; operators and helps you step by step to building a modern, functioning computer, OS and tetris Game.
The NAnd block stands for Not And.
It takes two binary inputs, A and B and outputs true only if they both aren't true.
   A B Output     0 0 1   1 0    1 1 0   0 1 1    To derive the Not operation we have to find a way of using NAnd to have this output:

Let's start with two photos:
Who won?
Try and guess who won in the two games.
In the first picture, even if you don't understand the game you can guess who won.
You can tell that the white is smashing the black into a corner.
And has more pieces in play.
Chess is a game based on domination.

By default Gmail doesn't support email importing from a file.
