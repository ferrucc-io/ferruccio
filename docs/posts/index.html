      If you're working on something new, there are so many directions your work and product can take.
The biggest risk is that you build something that is hard to explain and no one wants.
A good process minimizes this risk. Helping you move in the direction of building something people want.
To build June me and my cofounder Enzo used a very systematic approach. We decided to shared it as you might find useful.

      Sometimes I come back home from work, stuck on something, no adults to ask help to and a deadline in the morning.
I fall asleep thinking: &ldquo;Tomorrow is the day I'll get caught. This will be the one problem I won't be able to solve. The rest of my life is going to be misery and failure&rdquo;
Every morning though, with more or less pain things get sorted.
Anyways here's what you should do when you're stuck:

The poor things have such a cold experience of the world. Our eyes while giving us a richer experience of the world are also a limited mechanical tool.
The world doesn't care though. It stays the same regardless of the tools we use to perceive it - whether it's the eyes of a dog or my presbyc ones.
This sounds like stoner talk, but hear me out.

      Most founders in tech will tell you that they're a contrarian
But is being a contrarian an optimal decision? What are the alternatives? Is being a contrarian an advantage?
Founders of high growth companies, are making one big high risk high reward bet.
If you're looking for a big win you first have to find something that has high uncertainty.
For example, there's high uncertainty around when VR will become mainstream.

      The ability to make friendships through your passions is the best super power that the internet gives us.
The best things that happened in my life happened through communities on the internet.
Here’s a story of all the places I hanged out on the internet and made friends from.
 Until the first year of high school I’ve been offline. My experience until then with the internet was running a Blogspot to sell snacks in middle school (with someone who's still one of my best friends) and having a messenger account on my dad’s computer.

      One of the most interesting thought experiments one can do is exploring the history of aesthetics.
Human aesthetics change over time in ways that reflect progress.
How did people get bored of Greek tragedy? Why did chubby people become unattractive, when did people start liking squares on a canvas?
There was a moment when Dante's books were considered good. When realistic paintings like Church's Niagara were the pinnacle of art.

      An axiomatic deduction of &ldquo;Healthcare should not be free&rdquo; starting from 5 agreeable axioms.
I like the idea of my site being a snapshot of my thoughts that I can point to people when having a discussion.
I don't like repeating the same arguments over and over.
So here are some of my thoughts on &ldquo;Socialised Healthcare&rdquo;[1] for wider exposure and future reference.
I'll start with 5 agreeable axioms and use them systematically to derive &ldquo;Healthcare should not be free&rdquo;

      Doing the nand2tetris course is an extremely enlightning experience into the world of computers.
The course starts from the simplest building block, the &ldquo;NAND&rdquo; operators and helps you step by step to building a modern, functioning computer, OS and tetris Game.
The NAnd block stands for Not And.
It takes two binary inputs, A and B and outputs true only if they both aren't true.
   A B Output     0 0 1   1 0    1 1 0   0 1 1    To derive the Not operation we have to find a way of using NAnd to have this output:

 Note taking I take a lot of notes. After trying many apps I've settled on Apple Notes. My thinking here is that the standard Notes app is here to stay. Even if I ever go broke I still should still be able to access it.

  The main learning here was that organizational design and culture are a fascinating topic, and that they might be as important then company size when picking a job.

You're a competent programmer looking for a change in working environment.
You’ve got 4 offers from four companies at different stages.
