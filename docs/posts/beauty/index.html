<p>Human aesthetics change over time in ways that reflect progress.</p>
<p>How did people get bored of Greek tragedy? Why did chubby people become unattractive, when did people start liking squares on a canvas?</p>
<p>There was a moment when Dante's books were considered good. When realistic paintings like Church's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_(Frederic_Edwin_Church)">Niagara</a> were the pinnacle of art.</p>
<p>Looking at the history of aesthetics is spying on the slow movement of human desires.</p>
<p>Most movements are slow, but sometimes we take a leap. These leaps are the most interesting moments we can observe.</p>
<p>Illuminism came slowly over a thousand years.</p>
<p>The French revolution is a leap that took a couple of years.</p>
<p>Impressionism took some years too.</p>
<p>Berlin wall fall was one day.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-happen">Why does this happen?</h2>
<p>It depends. Every movement is caused by many different things that change at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="kate-moss">Kate Moss</h2>
<p>In the beginning on the 90s beauty standards were quite basic.</p>
<p>Models were always in the same poses and in the same kind of photos. Same face, perfect teeth, same haircuts, same make up, same bodies.</p>
<p><img src="/beauty/1990-vogue-covers.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Lighting in all photos is used to enhance the subject's beauty.</p>
<p>Most importantly they all represented this same idea of glamour.</p>
<p>In June 1990, a hip magazine from the UK called &ldquo;The Face&rdquo;, published this cover of a 16 year old Kate Moss:</p>
<p><img src="/beauty/kate-moss-the-face.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/beauty/km-1990.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a skinny girl, but not in a glamourous way.</p>
<p>Struggling to keep her eyes open, fighting with the light.</p>
<p>With messy hair, crooked teeth, no makeup and a childish aura.</p>
<p>This is the illogical next step.</p>
<p>This is not something you should look with the eyes of someone that has spent 10 years on Instagram and Tumblr.</p>
<p>You should look at this with the eyes of someone that had seen 10 years of Ivana Trump.</p>
<p>Within 3 years, the Kate Moss you see on &ldquo;The Face&rdquo; was polished to became the mainstream aesthetic.</p>

</div>

<p>British Vogue put her on their cover in March of 1993</p>
<p><img src="/beauty/1993-kate-moss.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And inside that edition of the magazine you can see her, freezing, standing next to a radiator.</p>
<p><img src="/beauty/kate-moss-corinne-day.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I like thinking that Kate Moss in 3 years shifted the mainstream idea of beauty to our current aesthetic.</p>
<p>Moving mainstream aesthetics from 6trophy wives to broke students in a room with no heating is fucking cool.</p>
<h2 id="maria-callas">Maria Callas</h2>
<p>Maria Callas was an American-born Greek soprano.</p>
<p>She was educated in Greece and had some experience singing in American theatres.</p>
<p>As an opera singer normal career path she had to gain approval in the Italian scene to get recognition. So she came to Italy.</p>
<p>The Teatro alla Scala in Milan is the Santiago Bernabeu of classical music</p>
<p><img src="/beauty/scala.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At the time the star at the Scala was Renata Tebaldi, an Italian soprano, extremely technical and perfect by traditional standards.</p>
<p>When you hear Renata Tebaldi singing, you can tell she's always in control of her voice, she's the Barbie of opera singing.</p>
<p>Maria Callas instead is a bit of the opposite. Her voice is full of energy, but it's almost like she can't hold it in.</p>
<p>So when Maria Callas arrived to the Scala people went crazy. Opera nuts are still fighting over who's better between Maria Callas and Renata Tebaldi.</p>
<p>Here's a side by side comparison:</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TzdOgM3bTz8" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>Maria Callas broke the aesthetic bringing chaotic passion and emotions.</p>
<p>If you aren't convinced here's her version of Amami Alfredo - from Verdi's Traviata</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2G3bLB5LVIY" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="disruption">Disruption</h3>
<p>Once something is replicated or executed perfectly the only way to move forward is through disruption.</p>
<p>Breakthroughs can only happen in an illogical ways in an illogical directions.</p>
<p>Iterative progress is about repetition, mastering a skill endlessly until you get it perfect.</p>
<p>Ivanka Trump and Renata Tebaldi are the perfection of a certain aesthetic.</p>
<p>Kate Moss and Maria Callas are the breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Disruption happens everywhere and all of the time, you just have to look for it.</p>
<p>A more recent example of pop culture breakthrough is XXXTentacion's Look At Me hitting the charts in 2017</p>

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJGcwEv7838" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>

<p>A home made distorted, badly mastered song in 2017 charts was the illogical next step.</p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p>Aesthetics and human progress move in similar ways.</p>
<p>To move things forward in the world we have to be on the look for the next breakthrough.</p>
<p>There is no systematic way of coming up with one.</p>
<p>The best chance we have is staying curious, exploring sudden and weird changes across the world, in our history and in every field.</p>
<p>Then trying to come up with our own.</p>
