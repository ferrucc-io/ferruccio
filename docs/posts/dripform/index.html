<p>A little more than two months ago <a href="https://twitter.com/kpavlovsky_pro">Konstantin</a> asked me how long would it take for me to develop something that would let him receive forms on his website as Telegram messages.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how long it would take, but finding the task interesting I decided to just do it.</p>

<p>In an afternoon of work I made the first version of &ldquo;Dripform&rdquo;.</p>

<p>After making it I started exchanging ideas via email with <a href="https://twitter.com/marcantoinefon">Marc-Antoine</a> who is working on a similar product. (btw Marc thanks for correcting my messages in french)</p>

<p>For around a month I never found enough time to finalise the project and didn&rsquo;t think that much about it.</p>

<p>When I finished my last exam though I finally spent a night preparing for the launch, making Gifs:</p>

<h3 id="the-product">The Product</h3>

<p>For this product I decided I wanted to keep everything as simple as possible and avoid over-engineering.</p>

<p>So the stack of the project is pretty straightforward to understand.</p>

<p>For the back end I used an express/node server to handle the api requests and a high level telegram library to handle messaging.</p>

<p>The front end is just plain html/css with a sprinkle of javascript, no frameworks. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible. <strong>I wanted the website to give the vibe of the product, which is simple, yet fast and elegant.</strong></p>

<p>The website is served using nginx on a Ubuntu Linode instance. The setup of the server was probably the most painful part in the development process as I was used to building node apps with <a href="https://zeit.co">zeit.co</a> that automates most of the things I had to handle.</p>

<p>Building the website didn&rsquo;t take me a lot of time, in fact I spent most of my time refining the details and problems as they came up using it.</p>

<h3 id="the-launch">The Launch</h3>

<p>After getting the first users through the Solo Founders Telegram group a couple of weeks ago, I decided to launch on Product Hunt, even if I was leaving on the day of the launch and couldn&rsquo;t spend much time on promotion.</p>

<p>To prepare for the launch <a href="https://twitter.com/matteing">Sergio</a> sent me a link to <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreyAzimov">Andrey Azimov</a>&rsquo;s latest product <a href="https://previewhunt.com">Preview Hunt</a> which turned out to be extremely useful.</p>

<h2 id="the-result">The Result</h2>

<p>I managed to gather more than 100 upvotes and to be on the front page which converted to many users.
What I learned from the last launch was that making good products is possible, from this one I wanted to have as many users as possible and get as many people as possible to use my product.</p>

<p>In the weeks following the launch I wasn&rsquo;t able to answer all of the feedback I received (hundreds of messages) as I was offline for a couple of weeks, working and traveling in Paris and Burgundy.</p>

<p>Extra Credits and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/kpavlovsky_pro">Konstantin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/enthusiausted">Marco</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pyyding">Kaspar</a> that helped me make important decisions for the product.</p>
