<h2 id="what-happens-if-i-share-my-browsing-history-publicly">What happens if I share my browsing history publicly?</h2>
<p>Initially I thought that people would have some cool things to say when introducing themselves via email and maybe suggest some cool resources.</p>
<p>I also thought that maybe someone was going to stalk me and do something weird.</p>
<p>I obviously decided to move forward and try to implement this with software.</p>
<h2 id="-the-code-side-of-things">üë®üèº‚Äçüíª The Code side of things</h2>
<p>The first step was figuring out &ldquo;Where does Chrome store my browsing history?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I was extremely surprised to find out that Chrome saves this data on an SQLite database that you can find here:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/History
</code></pre><p>So to get my history I had to make a copy of that database and run an SQL query on it to get the data I wanted:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>SELECT url, title FROM urls
</code></pre><p>At first I was sharing the full URL, but then after a while I realised that sometimes there&rsquo;s dangerous stuff in the URL so I decided to strip away the exact page route from URLs and just leave the site name.</p>
<p>After getting the data and cleaning it up I also realised I don&rsquo;t have a backend for my personal site üòÇ</p>
<p>As I didn&rsquo;t want to create an app specifically to serve this data I considered the following approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Auto add to the site repository the history by editing the site source code and pushing changes to master so all the content is static.</li>
<li>Save all the data to a Google Spreadsheet and turn it into an API using <a href="https://sheety.co/">Sheety</a> and call the endpoint from the site to load the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second approach seemed the most convoluted and insulting to scalability and software engineering good practices, so I obviously picked it.</p>
<p>I used a Python library called <code>gspread</code> to get the google sheets workflow up and running and that&rsquo;s basically it on the technical side of things.</p>
<h2 id="-the-cool-side-of-things">üåª The Cool side of things</h2>
<p><strong>So what happened?</strong></p>
<p>My friends started sending me screenshots of my history edited with either obscure types of porn or hilarious funny titles.</p>
<p>No one emailed me mentioning something from my history üò¢</p>
