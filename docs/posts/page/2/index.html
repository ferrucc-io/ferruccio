  The main learning here was that organizational design and culture are a fascinating topic, and that they might be as important then company size when picking a job.
 Let's say you're early in your Software Engineer career.
You're a competent programmer looking for a change in working environment.

      How two board games shape the concept of conflict in the western world and China.
Let's start with two photos:
Who won?
Try and guess who won in the two games.
In the first picture, even if you don't understand the game you can guess who won.
You can tell that the white is smashing the black into a corner.
And has more pieces in play.
Chess is a game based on domination.

What's the fastest and easiest way to get a test account up and running?
By default Gmail doesn't support email importing from a file.
So the first step we'll have to go through is creating an Outlook email account here:

After creating an Outlook account we need to import data into it.
The reason I suggest you use Outlook is that it supports a format called .

I also developed an instinct to spot trends.
Mostly to find opportunities, but also for fun.

I found that every time I meet someone in person that codes professionally the discussion at a certain point moves to ‚ÄúWhat do you listen when you code?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is your favourite genre/artist?‚Äù.
Here's what developers from big cities in the 20-30 age group tend to listen.

      6 years ago this video came out.
  At the time I couldn‚Äôt code yet.
This concept is still mind blowing to me.
Up until now I always thought about code as a collection of files, connected through imports.
But really we import functions, not files.
We use files to store code because they're a convenient way to serialize code. They're not the best representation, in fact functions might provide a better one.

So let's go back a hundred years to get some inspiration.
Inspiration from the 1920s After selling 100 million books of his series Little Blue Book marketer Julius Hadleman wrote a book analysing all the data he had collected.
The book title is &ldquo;The First Hundred Million&rdquo; and it came out in 1928 (email me if you need help finding it) and features an interesting collection of proven Titles that work and insights on what we're interested in reading.
