      If there's something that I held as a deep belief growing up is that there is not such a thing as a free lunch.
I also developed an instinct to spot trends.
Mostly to find opportunities, but also for fun.
So when I stumbled upon Andrew Yang. I listened to a couple of his interviews and realised his ideas are powerful and bipartisan.
The way he talks makes him likable both on the left and on the right.

      The music I like isn’t that ordinary, but I'd say it's popular among developers in my age group.
I found that every time I meet someone in person that codes professionally the discussion at a certain point moves to “What do you listen when you code?”, “What is your favourite genre/artist?”.
Here's what developers from big cities in the 20-30 age group tend to listen.

      6 years ago this video came out.
  At the time I couldn’t code yet.
This concept is still mind blowing to me.
Up until now I always thought about code as a collection of files, connected through imports.
But really we import functions, not files.
We use files to store code because they're a convenient way to serialize code. They're not the best representation, in fact functions might provide a better one.

      I'm 21, but I've been blogging for almost 10 years.
I grew up doing this.
What I've written on the internet has reached millions of people. Most of what I've written is in Italian, but I was also quite successful when writing in english. My Quora profile, reached 400k people in three months.
Through blogging I had the opportunity to travel the world, getting free tickets to all the biggest music festivals (Ultra, Tomorrowland.

      Marketing on the internet isn't much different from Marketing on any other medium.
So let's go back a hundred years to get some inspiration.
Inspiration from the 1920s After selling 100 million books of his series Little Blue Book marketer Julius Hadleman wrote a book analysing all the data he had collected.
The book title is &ldquo;The First Hundred Million&rdquo; and it came out in 1928 (email me if you need help finding it) and features an interesting collection of proven Titles that work and insights on what we're interested in reading.

1) Selling Pain Points We can divide products into three different groups: candies, painkillers and vitamins.
We don't want to have much to do with candies.
Vitamins are interesting.
We love Painkillers.
For Cyber security software it's hard to be a painkiller as what we're generally trying to do is prevent attacks.

      In the last month a group of hackers called Magecart came back striking in full force.
They first appeared in the news back in 2015 when RiskIQ found out they injected code in Magento's &ldquo;Magecart&rdquo; shopping software. Thus the name.
The attacks they organized have caused massive damages to hundreds, likely even thousands of companies like British Airways, Ticketmaster and even Newegg.
This group is specialized in card skimming payment forms on the internet.

      Two months ago I hadn't launched any solo project that got users.
Until lately everything I had ever done was with someone else, usually with a compatible skillset. The problem with this approach is that if someone on the team loses interest or is busy the project dies out.
As this happened a couple of times I decided to take some time and work on projects by myself.
The products I launched Klipped.

I wasn't sure how long it would take, but finding the task interesting I decided to just do it.
In an afternoon of work I made the first version of &ldquo;Dripform&rdquo;.
After making it I started exchanging ideas via email with Marc-Antoine who is working on a similar product.
