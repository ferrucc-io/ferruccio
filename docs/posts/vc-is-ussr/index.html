<p><strong>They gain ownership forcibly.</strong>
In exchange for money, for the bet they gain equity (this doesn&rsquo;t always have to happen, when a bank gives you credit it doesn&rsquo;t become a partner).
In this way if the <em>company</em> becomes <em>a &ldquo;Unicorn&rdquo;</em>, the <em>equity value increases so much</em> that it covers the losses from the other failed <em>startups</em>, that got money, but failed.</p>

<p>After this financing operation the <em>VC</em> doesn&rsquo;t check their investment too much.
They just follow the <em>Blog</em> for announcements, but not really understanding what the <em>startup</em> is really about they set a time frame for the investment to generate &ldquo;returns&rdquo; or <em>either exit or go public</em> in case of success.</p>

<p>There is no evalutation of the technological value of a project, not even of its feasability.
<em>Theranos,</em> for example promised something that anyone that has spent 5 minutes in <em>medical research</em> lab would find impossible. The results were fake. But no one really experimented the technology with indipendent scientists BEFORE investing. And also when researchers talked, they were ignored.</p>

<p>No one looks at the CV of the founder of a <em>Startup</em>. Neither the industry or academic experience count. It&rsquo;s not particularly important to have worked in similar companies or holding a degree. What counts is being part of <em>&ldquo;the Silicon Valley culture&rdquo;</em>, even a disastrous past is ignored because of a positive &ldquo;failure culture&rdquo;, the idea that a failure is testimony of <em>courage and of a risk taking attitude.</em></p>
