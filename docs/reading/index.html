<p>Everything below here is my answer to those questions:</p>
<h3 id="when-breath-becomes-air">When Breath Becomes Air</h3>
<p>At the end of 2018 <a href="https://www.ryanckulp.com/">Ryan Kulp</a> suggested that I read this book.</p>
<p>I'm so glad I followed his advice as it was moving to read this.</p>
<p>Being a fairly happy person, I almost always the topic of death and health, in my reading list and even in my daily thoughts.</p>
<p>I think this spans from the fact that my ideas on religion and faith are very confused.</p>
<p>If you want to read about how doctors think, think about meaning and how to die with dignity I strongly recommend this book.</p>
<h3 id="made-in-america">Made in America</h3>
<p>I really started reading around 4 years ago. I thought I had found a secret weapon that would make me change for the better.</p>
<p>What really stuck with me was the first autobiography I ever read: &ldquo;Made in America&rdquo; by Sam Walton.</p>
<p>I think that the powerful ideas of &ldquo;every penny we save is a penny our customers save&rdquo; is the only way to keep a huge corporation lean and not wasteful. I read in the Jeff Bezos biography that this book strongly influenced the culture of Amazon and how it operates.</p>
<h3 id="hackers-and-painters">Hackers and Painters</h3>
<p>This collection of essays by Paul Graham was a mind blowing read.</p>
<p>After reading this I started learning Common Lisp and eventually Clojure (as I couldn't figure out how to build anything useful with Common Lisp).</p>
<h3 id="ryan-kulphttpswwwryanckulpcom"><a href="https://www.ryanckulp.com/">Ryan Kulp</a></h3>
<p>Reading Ryan's posts I fully embraced the idea that in communication the most important things is honesty.</p>
<p>Honesty shines through and brings trust.</p>
<p>It's a long term play, but it's worth it.</p>
<h3 id="james-altucherhttpsjamesaltuchercom"><a href="https://jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a></h3>
<p>This guy is a scammer selling info products on anything that is hot (crypto, stocks, self help.. maybe even weight loss).</p>
<p>But after reading some of his posts I started writing in a different way. He's able to show his vulnerabilities in his words. The things I read about him were emotionally touching and extremely refreshing.</p>
<p>He builds trust showing his vulnerabilities and that's something I want to do too.</p>
<h3 id="nathan-barry">Nathan Barry</h3>
<p>I haven't read much by him, but I know he embraces the idea of sharing everything he learns.</p>
<p>I think I heard a podcast with him, and his words really resonated with me</p>
<p>He adds a new dimension to the two values I listed before, adding &ldquo;openness&rdquo; to honesty and vulnerability.</p>
