  <meta property="og:description" content="Since starting to work on June, I haven’t read a lot of books. I only read a few Substack posts for fun and go out for long walks.
My favorite blog right now is Samo Burja’s Bismarck Brief. Every week I get a new post on something I would’ve never thought of being interesting.
I also like reading the Palladium Magazine.
Occasionally, I also like reading reactionary blogs like Curtis Yarvin’s Gray Mirror - but I’ve found them a bit too repetitive with time. I enjoy reading about edgy ideas of every kind, so if you have any recommendations, please let me know!">
