      <description>I like building things without thinking too much. This works extremely well when building something small on my own.
When working with other people this doesn&#39;t scale. Having a rational method and strategy in approaching problems allows your team to make decisions independently, so you can move faster.
If you want to build something amazing having a strong method makes all the difference.
While building June me and Enzo have defined our process and are sharing it with you.</description>
