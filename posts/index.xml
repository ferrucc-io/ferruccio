&lt;p>Also now that AI has taken over most coding editors it&amp;rsquo;s annoying to have to deal with autocomplete and tab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I write my thoughts I don&amp;rsquo;t want AI to get in the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So today I decided to build a small web server with an editor that I can use to edit my articles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Multi Day Hikes</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/multi-day-hikes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/multi-day-hikes/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that doing multi-day hikes is the perfect break from the keyboard.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main benefit for me over spending a week on the beach somewhere is that my day to day is already very sedentary.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two years ago we raised a little over $2 million dollars as a seed round from some of the smartest investors in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, Louis, our board member asked us to give a presentation to share our learnings with other companies in the Pointnine portfolio. We got great feedback from fellow founders after the presentation - so today I&amp;rsquo;m sharing our learnings publicly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building friend catchers</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/friendcatchers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 17:47:42 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/friendcatchers/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a 13 year old, my dad’s advice on internet presence was:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Everything you post will be used against you in the future. So you should never associate your name with anything on the internet”.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>As a rebellious teenager my view was the opposite:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>“Everything you post on the internet will get lost. You should associate your real name with everything you find interesting”&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think looking back, this might be the most useful lesson I learned from my high school years.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The heartbeat of your startup</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/throughput/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 May 2021 10:39:53 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/throughput/</guid><description>&lt;p>The only thing that matters is throughput.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becoming the most prolific version of yourself is the most important thing you can do to become proud of your work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Making a group of people become the most prolific version of themselves sounds like a reasonable way to build a great company. So that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughput is the speed of getting to some outputs.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>The value of these properties is mutable and has no relationship with time.

&lt;p>The poor things have such a cold experience of the world. Our eyes while giving us a richer experience of the world are also a limited mechanical tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world doesn&amp;rsquo;t care though. It stays the same regardless of the tools we use to perceive it - whether it&amp;rsquo;s the eyes of a dog or my presbyc ones.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for a big win you first have to find something that has high uncertainty.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The best things that happened in my life happened through communities on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s a story of all the places I hanged out on the internet and made friends from.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Until the first year of high school I’ve been offline. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>My experience until then with the internet was running a Blogspot to sell snacks in middle school (with someone who&amp;rsquo;s still one of my best friends) and having a messenger account on my dad’s computer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beauty</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/beauty/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 17:34:45 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/beauty/</guid><description>&lt;p>One of the most interesting thought experiments one can do is exploring the history of aesthetics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Human aesthetics change over time in ways that reflect progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did people get bored of Greek tragedy? Why did chubby people become unattractive, when did people start liking squares on a canvas?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a moment when Dante&amp;rsquo;s books were considered good. When realistic paintings like Church&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_(Frederic_Edwin_Church)">Niagara&lt;/a> were the pinnacle of art.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking at the history of aesthetics is spying on the slow movement of human desires.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Healthcare should not be free</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/healthcare/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 May 2020 19:01:25 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/healthcare/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>An axiomatic deduction of &amp;ldquo;Healthcare should not be free&amp;rdquo; starting from 5 agreeable axioms.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The NAnd block stands for Not And.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes two binary inputs, A and B and outputs true only if they both aren&amp;rsquo;t true.&lt;/p>

We use files to store code because they&amp;rsquo;re a convenient way to serialize code.

Showing some &lt;em>building, a product and have employees (working or not)&lt;/em> the money flows him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sales for Cybersecurity Saas</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/sales-for-cybersecurity-saas/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2018 19:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/sales-for-cybersecurity-saas/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost I month after I started working on &lt;a href="https://magehash.com">Magehash&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is my first cybersecurity product I&amp;rsquo;ve ever developed so I decided to share what I learned so far!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-selling-pain-points">1) Selling Pain Points&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We can divide products into three different groups: candies, painkillers and vitamins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t want to have much to do with candies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vitamins are interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We love Painkillers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Cyber security software it&amp;rsquo;s hard to be a painkiller as what we&amp;rsquo;re generally trying to do is prevent attacks. Generally these kinds of products are like vitamins, they make us stronger, but we don&amp;rsquo;t really notice the effect they have on our health.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Everything you need to know on Magecart Attacks</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/magecart/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Oct 2018 19:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/magecart/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last month a group of hackers called Magecart came back striking in full force.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They first appeared in the news back in 2015 when &lt;a href="https://riskiq.com">RiskIQ&lt;/a> found out they injected code in Magento&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Magecart&amp;rdquo; shopping software. Thus the name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The attacks they organized have caused massive damages to hundreds, likely even thousands of companies like British Airways, Ticketmaster and even Newegg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This group is specialized in card skimming payment forms on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lessons from launching on Product Hunt</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/lessons-from-ph/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Sep 2018 19:18:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/lessons-from-ph/</guid><description>&lt;p>Two months ago I hadn&amp;rsquo;t launched any solo project that got users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until lately everything I had ever done was with someone else, usually with a compatible skillset.
The problem with this approach is that if someone on the team loses interest or is busy the project dies out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this happened a couple of times I decided to take some time and work on projects by myself.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A little more than two months ago &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kpavlovsky_pro">Konstantin&lt;/a> asked me how long would it take for me to develop something that would let him receive forms on his website as Telegram messages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure how long it would take, but finding the task interesting I decided to just do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an afternoon of work I made the first version of &amp;ldquo;Dripform&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After making it I started exchanging ideas via email with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcantoinefon">Marc-Antoine&lt;/a> who is working on a similar product. (btw Marc thanks for correcting my messages in french)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What is wrong with Italy?</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/italy-s-problems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Jun 2018 19:12:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/italy-s-problems/</guid><description>&lt;p>We now have a government in Italy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everyone around me is talking about this, so I figured out I might as well try to analyse what are the biggest problems the country is facing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is a list of existential problems we face:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Labor Market laws make it almost impossible or extremely costly to hire/fire anyone.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Organised Crime, Tax evasion, Corruption and waste of public money plague the country.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The juidicial system is extremely slow and inefficient. If someone scams you, you might have to wait years for them to be prosecuted.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Idea to MVP in a Saturday Night</title><link>https://ferrucc.io/posts/6-dollar-mvp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2018 16:46:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ferrucc.io/posts/6-dollar-mvp/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every time you finish writing a blog post you get that feeling that it&amp;rsquo;s not ready to post it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s time for proofreading, but it&amp;rsquo;s painful to proofread your own writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is fun instead is reading someone else&amp;rsquo;s writings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So how great would it be if you could post your drafts somewhere, read and comment a couple of blog posts by people with your same interests, while your own get proofread by people like you?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
