It's been almost I month after I started working on [Magehash](https://magehash.com)

This is my first cybersecurity product I've ever developed so I decided to share what I learned so far!

## 1) Selling Pain Points

We can divide products into three different groups: candies, painkillers and vitamins.

We don't want to have much to do with candies.

Vitamins are interesting.

We love Painkillers.

For Cyber security software it's hard to be a painkiller as what we're generally trying to do is prevent attacks. Generally these kinds of products are like vitamins, they make us stronger, but we don't really notice the effect they have on our health.

Businesses think in terms of revenue growth, so it's easy to pitch something that increases revenue.

It's much harder to convince someone that they have a possible security problem and that they should try to address it. Managers don't care and unless it isn't a common security practice companies are skeptical.

So Magehash is like a superfood, if it becomes trendy it's something like Goji Berries, if it fails it becomes something like Cordyceps Extracts (a superfood nobody eats).

## 2) Cold Emailing

Magehash's main application is to protect websites from credit card skimmers.

One thing I'm trying to gather data for is what threat monitoring dashboards companies are using.

The problem is that when you ask people "What platform are you using to host your videos?" it sounds innocuous.

When you ask "How are you protecting yourself from x attacks?" or "What is your Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system?" people get suspicious.

It's perfectly acceptable for possible leads to be skeptical when receiving this kind of emails.

The only way I've seen cold emailing work for this kind of products is with **introductions**.
