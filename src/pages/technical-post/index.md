After spending a while working with React components and after getting comfortable with them I tried to get a freelance job on Upwork as a React developer.
Much to my surprise I managed to find a job within 24 hrs of getting on the platform, from a friend, but still impressive to me.

While job hunting and scrolling through pages of job offers I came across with tons of React Native developer positions.
While asking for gigs to friends I also got asked a lot how my "React Native" skills were.

[Lambda School](https://lambdaschool.com/) teaches React Native to its students to get them high paying jobs, so I think it's a good idea to learn it.

About a week ago I started getting my hands dirty with the React Native docs, and learned most of the basics and useful things by playing around.
Now it's time for me to build and ship my first cross platform app.
