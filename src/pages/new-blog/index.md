This Gatsby.js Blog is my new personal website.

The idea is to create content I would enjoy, without focusing on the medium or the container which I realised is not really important.

For now it's been a while since I last wrote something interesting, so if you're **hungry** for content here are some websites I enjoy:
 
* [Gwern](https://gwern.net)
* [The Browser](https://thebrowser.com)
* [Project Syndicate](https://www.project-syndicate.org/)
* [Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
* [Raw Nerve - Blog Post Series](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rawnerve)
* [RibbonFarm](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/)

Not many other websites come to my mind at the moment

PS: If you have some links I might enjoy DM me on Twitter or hit me up at hi *[at]* my personal website's domain name.
