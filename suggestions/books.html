		<h1>Books I liked (since August 2017)</h1>
		<br />
			<h3>Currently Reading: Hacking the Art of Exploitation</h3>
			<h4>by Jon Erickson | January 2018</h4>
			<p>Very interesting book I'm reading while doing the Cryptopals challenge. It made me go study some peculiar aspects of C programming that I didn't remember well (like using GDB to debug instead of the IDE stuff) or that I never used before (like pointer typecasting and program access permissions). Hard to make time for it as it requires to hack around a computer to really learn.</p>
			<h3>Currently reReading: On China</h3>
			<h4>by Henry Kissinger | March 2018</h4>
			<p>It's my second time reading this book, but it's worth it. Every time I start to read this book I understand something different, so it's definetly very interesting.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Hackers and Painters</h3>
			<h4>by Paul Graham | March 2018</h4>
			<p>This book is a collection of deliberately provoking essays on technoloy. Please Note: Reading this book will make you dive in to Lisp programming.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers</h3>
			<h4>by Ben Horowitz | February 2018</h4>
			<p>I love to read autobiographic books and I find books like this one the most insightful reads one can have. This book was written to be a better CEO, but outlines perfectly the struggles of any boss you'll ever have.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>The road to learn React</h3>
			<h4>by Robin Wieruch | December 2017</h4>
			<p>Great resource to learn React in a couple of days.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Tango with Django</h3>
			<h4>by Leif Azzopardi | October-November 2017</h4>
			<p>A great book if you already know how to code in Python and are familiar with HTML and CSS.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Flashboys</h3>
			<h4>by Michael Lewis | September 2017</h4>
			<p>A friend of mine borrowed me this book to read and I really enjoyed. It's an extremely nice and entertaining book. I was hooked from the beginning and finished it in a couple of days.</p><p>If you have the time and want something fun to read that is not fiction it's a great book.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Deep Work</h3>
			<h4>by Cal Newport | September 2017</h4>
			<p>The first time I read this book was last year.</p> <p>I decided to read it again, because I think that as a student it's one of those books you always have to have in mind.</p>	<p>What the author says in the book now sounds to me as common sense. For some reason though I find it hard to find other people that share this point of view.</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman</h3>
			<h4>by Richard Feynman | August 2017</h4>
			<p>This is the crazy autobiography of Richard Feynman.</p> <p>A truly amazing read that made me see myself to a certain extent very similar to him (minus the Nobel Prize obviously).</p>	<p>He had to understand things in simple terms and couldn't handle formalism and rituals. He just went straight to the point. His fa√ßade for being such a "curious character" as he describes himself is that he's a simpleton from a working class background, not an intellectual and this let's him get away with whatever he does. Definitely a recommended read. </p>
